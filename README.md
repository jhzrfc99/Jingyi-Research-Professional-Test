### Inconsistent disclosures may be related to fund performance because they could indicate the presence of adverse events that the hedge fund adviser is attempting to hide or downplay. For example, if a hedge fund had a history of regulatory sanctions, but did not disclose this in their Part 2 brochure, this could signal to investors that the fund is not trustworthy and that there may be other undisclosed risks associated with investing in the fund. Furthermore, selective disclosure may indicate that the fund has something to hide or is not operating with transparency and integrity, which could ultimately impact investor confidence and the fund's performance.
